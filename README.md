# DTMF-Decoder
DTMF is a Telecommunication Signaling system which uses the voice frequency band over telephone lines between telephone equipment and other communication devices and switching centers. It is one kind of signaling system intended for identifying the push buttons for example on the number keypad. A key can be formed by combining two sine waves tones .

DTMF decoder can be a circuit or a program which recognizes a phone tone from the phone line and then decodes the pressed key on the keypad of the telephone. In order to decode DTMF we use decoding algorithm called Goertzel algorithm. Which is digital signal processing technique. For efficient evaluation of the individual terms of DFT.  The main calculation in Geortzal  algorithm has a form of a digital filter. The filter operates on a input sequence X(n) in a cascade parameter giving the frequency to be analyzed and normalized 2 radians per sample. Generally these this type of algorithm is used to formulate the bandpass filter which is within the range od 680kHz to 1700kHz
